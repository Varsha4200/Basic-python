Introduction to Python

What is Python?
High-level, interpreted programming language
Known for readability and simplicity
Versatile for various applications (web development, data science, machine learning, automation)
Why Python?
Easy to learn and use
Large and active community
Extensive libraries and frameworks
Setting up Python Environment:

Download and install Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/
Verify installation by opening a command prompt and typing python --version
Consider using a code editor or IDE (Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, Jupyter Notebook)
Basic Syntax Indentation:
Python uses whitespace (indentation) to define code blocks
Consistent indentation is crucial for correct execution
Typically, 4 spaces are used
Variables and Data Types:
Variables store data values
No need to declare data types explicitly
Common data types:
Integers (whole numbers)
Floating-point numbers (decimal numbers)
Strings (text)
Booleans (True or False)
Example:
Python
name = "Alice"
age = 30
is_student = False

Operators:
Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, //, %, **)
Comparison operators (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=)
Logical operators (and, or, not)
Example:
Python
result = 5 + 3
is_greater = 10 > 5

Control Flow
Conditional Statements:
if, else, elif statements for decision-making
Indentation determines code blocks
Example:
Python
if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult")
else:
    print("You are a minor")

Loops:
for loops for iterating over sequences
while loops for repeating code based on a condition
Example:

Python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
count = 0
while count < 3:
    print("Count:", count)
    count += 1

Functions
Reusable blocks of code
Defined using the def keyword
Can take parameters and return values
Example:
Python
def greet(name):
    print("Hello,", name)
greet("Boby")

Data Structures
Lists:
Ordered collections of items
Mutable (can be changed)
Example:
Python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
fruits.append("grape")

Tuples:
Ordered collections of items
Immutable (cannot be changed)
Example:
Python
coordinates = (3, 4)

Dictionaries:
Unordered collections of key-value pairs
Example:
Python
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}

Input and Output
Input:
input() function to get user input
Example:
Python
name = input("Enter your name: ")

Output:
print() function to display output
Example:
Python
print("Hello,", name)

Error and Exception Handling
Use try and except blocks to handle errors
Common exceptions: ValueError, TypeError, IndexError
Example:
Python
try:
    num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid input")
Use code with caution.

Additional Topics (Optional)
Modules and packages
File handling
Object-oriented programming
Regular expressions
Libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib)
Exercises and Practice
Provide hands-on exercises to reinforce learning
Encourage experimentation and pro
